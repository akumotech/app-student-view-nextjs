## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up the application on your local machine or cloud server.

## Installation

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Application

You can run the API monitoring application either on an **AWS EC2 instance** or on your **local machine**.

## Frontend on AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)

1. **Prepare the Environment**  
   Ensure you have an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023 with SSH access.

2. **Run the Setup Script**  
   The repository contains a `setup.sh` script to help you install Node.js and npm. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup.sh

   ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**
   After running the setup script, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

4. **Update .env file**
   Open the .env file and update the values with Backend URL or IP address (if you skipped Step 2)

   ```bash
   BACKEND_URL="192.168.1.0:8000"
   ```

5. **Build the Project for Production**
   Build the project in preparation for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build

   ```

6. **Start the Production Server**
   Once the build is complete, you can start the production server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## For Local Development

Start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Linting

A custom linting script is available, which uses **Prettier** for code formatting. To check and automatically format code:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This runs:

```sh
prettier --check --write .
```
