# Typing Test Feature Integration & Refactor

## Overview

This document describes the migration and integration of the open-source `typing-test` feature into the main `app-student-view-nextjs` project. The goal was to preserve all original functionality, ensure code quality, and achieve full design and UX consistency with the main application.

## 1. Folder Structure

The feature is implemented under a new route: `/typing-test`.

```
app/
  typing-test/
    page.tsx
    components/
      TypingArea.tsx
      Stats.tsx
      CircularProgress.tsx
    context/
      TypingTestContext.tsx
    utils/
      paragraph.ts
      unsupportedKeys.ts
```

## 2. Migration & Refactor Decisions

- **Component Decomposition:**

  - The original `Typing.tsx` was split into `TypingArea.tsx` (main logic/UI), `Stats.tsx` (stats display), and `CircularProgress.tsx` (timer/progress UI).
  - Context logic was moved to `TypingTestContext.tsx` for feature encapsulation.
  - Utilities (`paragraph`, `unsupportedKeys`) were moved to a local `utils/` folder.

- **Styling:**
  - All custom CSS was replaced with Tailwind utility classes.
  - Colors, spacing, and typography were aligned with the main app's design tokens (using `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, etc.).
